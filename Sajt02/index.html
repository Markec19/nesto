        Pastas are divided into two broad categories: dried (pasta secca) 
        and fresh (pasta fresca). <br>Most dried pasta is produced 
        commercially via an extrusion process, although it can be 
        produced at home. <br>Fresh pasta is traditionally produced by hand, 
        sometimes with the aid of simple machines. Fresh pastas 
        available in grocery stores are produced commercially by 
        large-scale machines.

   <p>
    As a category in <i>Italian cuisine</i>, both fresh and dried pastas 
    are classically used in one of three kinds of prepared dishes: 
   </p>
   <ol>
       <li>
        as <strong>pasta asciutta (or pastasciutta)</strong>, cooked pasta is plated and 
        served with a complementary sauce or condiment;
       </li>
       <li>
        a second classification of pasta dishes is <strong>pasta in brodo</strong>, 
        in which the pasta is part of a soup-type dish.  
       </li>
       <li> 
        A third category is 
       <b> pasta al forno</b>, in which the pasta is incorporated into a dish that 
        is subsequently baked in the oven.
       </li>
